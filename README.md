# Dodge The Creeps
My first game developed with Godot.
The concept is based on "Dodge the Creeps", a learning project described in Godot's step-by-step guide - see https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html
The version with the foxes is a little more kid-friendly and there are difficulty options included,<br>
while the raven version is more basic and may scare a kid due to red-eyed ravens and a creepy game-over sound.
